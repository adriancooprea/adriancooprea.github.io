## About

**"As a Man Thinketh"** is a timeless self-help classic written by [James Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Allen_(author)), published in **1903**.
The book revolves around the core idea that an individual's thoughts profoundly shape their reality and that harnessing the power of positive thinking can lead to personal growth and transformation.

Drawing from the biblical proverb, *"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he,"* Allen emphasizes that our thoughts, emotions, and beliefs are the foundation for our character, circumstances, and overall well-being.
By cultivating **self-awareness** and **self-discipline**, one can overcome limiting beliefs, achieve a **higher level of consciousness**, and ultimately manifest the life they desire.

In this book version, Sam Torode rephrases James Allen's original work in contemporary English using modern examples.
He makes it easier to grasp, understand, and internalize so that today's readers can take advantage of James's wisdom.

## Actionable ideas

#### 1. Practice self-awareness to identify negative thought patterns and work towards changing them

The whole book resolves around the idea, ***"What you think is what you are,"*** making `self-awareness` essential in improving happiness.
To start changing your life, you first need to change your thoughts; to do that, you must know what they are.
You need to be aware of them.
Once you've identified your unhealthy `behaviors` or `reactions`, you can start reframing your desired response based on the person you want to become.

> *Whenever someone says something negative about me, I get angry and start saying negative things about them. Instead, I should listen to what they say and think about it. There could be something to improve. Maybe they want to help.*

This practice is easier said than done.
It takes a lot of **mental muscle** to look at your behaviors and patterns and **admit** when they're wrong.
Even then, fighting the autopilot that's been driving you for all these years is a hard battle.

`Journaling` is a great tool to use for improving **self-awareness**.
This approach lets you put down your thoughts and revisit them once you've figured out what's been going wrong.
Here's a **template** that you could use when trying to identify poor behavioral patterns:
- **Situation**: describe the facts of the problem as it is. At this point, avoid opinions or interpretations.
- **Thoughts**: describe what you think of the problem. Here you can state opinions, interpretations, or anything that crosses your mind. The idea is to blow off the steam.
- **Current Behavior**: describe your reaction to the problem. Again, avoid opinions and interpretations. This is the hardest part of the process because you must be blunt and admit the facts. Sometimes, the truth hurts.
- **Reframed Behavior**: describe your desired reaction to the problem. How would you, ideally, handle it? What would be an appropriate response?

Here are some examples:
- **Situation**: a close friend criticized my recent life choices.
- **Thoughts**: maybe he's right about me. Everyone probably thinks the same. I'm not good enough.
- **Current Behavior**: I've been avoiding social gatherings where they might be present.
- **Reframed Behavior**: it's ok for friends to have different opinions. Their perspective is valid, but so is mine. I can communicate my feelings and work towards understanding and resolution.

- **Situation**: I was unexpectedly laid off from my job.
- **Thoughts**: I'm a failure. I will never find another job. My family will be disappointed in me.
- **Current Behavior**: I've been avoiding telling my family and spending more time alone.
- **Reframed Behavior**: losing my job is tough but does not reflect my worth. I have skills and experiences that are valuable. I can use this time to reassess my career goals and find new opportunities.

By becoming aware of your behavioral patterns, you are able to change them. By changing them, you are changing your **lives**.

#### 2. Define what you want to achieve and make a plan for it

Knowing what you want or who you want to be is only useful if you set some targets and make a concrete plan of execution.
Your thoughts need to be in **harmony** with your actions to achieve what you want.
Suppose you want to be fit but keep missing meals, eating junk food, and not following a specific routine.
It would be no surprise to see someone in this situation frustrated and hopeless.

When you put together an actionable **plan** and follow it, you reduce the conflict between who you are and who you want to be and start feeling good.
Because you develop a sense of purpose, you feel more energized and willing to take on the next challenge.
Finishing goal after goal builds up **momentum**, which acts as fuel on your journey.

However, setting goals and making plans takes a lot of work.
First, your **plan** needs to be `realistic`: you must adjust your targets based on your abilities and circumstances.
It's pointless to come up with something that is very unlikely to happen.
Second, your goals need to be `perfectly balanced`:
- They need to be **small enough**, so you feel you're making progress. A bigger goal is more likely to be abandoned.
- They need to be **slightly above your comfort zone**. If it's too easy, you'll get bored. If it's too hard, you'll get frustrated.
- They need to be **specific**. Ambiguous goals don't promote accountability(*"I want to eat less fats" vs. "I want to eat a maximum of 50g of fats each day"*).

Whenever you have a project in mind, try to break it down for a clearer view.
If simply writing doesn't help, and you're more into methods and frameworks, you can try the following:
- [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
- [GROW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GROW_model)
- [Backward Goal Setting](https://www.toolshero.com/personal-development/backward-goal-setting/)

#### 3. Take responsibility and cultivate self-discipline

Changing your life is all about responsibility and discipline.
On the one hand, it's easy to act as a victim and blame everything else because things are not how you want them to be.
Changing your life requires effort and getting through uncomfortable situations.
Learning new things might make you feel frustrated, anxious, nervous, and incompetent.
Admitting your flaws might make you uncomfortable, ashamed, and shattered.
You need to accept the improvement process and step out of your comfort zone to accomplish that goal you postponed for so long.

On the other hand, when you feel down and your motivation is depleted is very easy to give up.
When you start new things, your motivation rises, and you feel determined to work on your goals.
Think about the "new year's resolution," "I'll quit smoking starting from Monday," or "Starting from Monday, I'll go to the gym five times a week."
All these thoughts have become cliches because they were overused, and many didn't follow through.

So, to break it down, changing your life requires:
1. **Taking responsibility**: no matter how much you complain about it, no one will do it for you.
2. **Cultivate self-discipline**: motivation comes and goes. You need a reliable source of power to go to the end.

Taking responsibility is mainly done if you acknowledge your current situation, start making plans, and set goals to change it.
The more honest you're with yourself, the better.
Cultivating self-discipline, however, is a long shot.
- **Create a routine**: set in your calendar dedicated time for specific things like reading, writing, learning, shopping, napping, etc.This will help you stay focused.
- **Limit distractions by controlling your environment**: clean up your workspace, pause the notifications on your phone, and remove your phone from your working area.
- **Review goals and progress weekly**: see what works and what doesn't and adapt. Maybe you don't work hard enough; maybe you're not setting time aside for breaks and recovery.
- **Reward yourself once you achieve a goal**: give yourself a break. You deserve it. You worked hard for it.

## Key takeaways

#### 1. Happiness can only be found in living a purposeful life

Without a clear destination, you lose focus and waste energy radiating in all directions.
By concentrating your energy on a single point, you can increase the temperature thousands of times more than when you spread it out.
`Purpose` is like a **magnifying glass** that focuses your energy on a goal.
It gives you the drive to persevere, learn from mistakes, and feel confident in your pursuits.

The lack of purpose leads to constantly chasing the next [shiny object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiny_object_syndrome#:~:text=Shiny%20object%20syndrome%20is%20the,new%20can%20take%20its%20place.), leaving you feeling unsatisfied, like something is missing, or that you are not doing what you ought to.
This type of lifestyle leads to **insecurity, anxiety, and depression**.

#### 2. Health can be influenced by your thoughts

The mind and body are strongly interconnected.
Our mood can affect the immune system and other vital functions, impacting your overall well-being.

From the **biological** standpoint, positive thinking is correlated with positive vibes, hormones, and energy which all can positively influence your body cells and can set the rhythm for your entire body.
Even the [Placebo Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo) can improve your mood.

From the **psychological** standpoint, positive thinking fosters positive habits, which in turn foster positive outcomes.
For example, reading about nutrition and exercises will make you more careful about what you eat and how you train, which in turn will make your health better.

#### 3. Without changing your thinking, you cannot change your surroundings

It is important to recognize that the current circumstances you find yourself in are not solely a product of external factors, but also a result of your own **thought patterns, decision-making processes, and upbringing**.
Simply changing your external environment may not necessarily lead to a significant shift in your psychological state, as these internal factors must also be addressed.
It is crucial to take a holistic approach to understanding the complexities of your **emotional and mental well-being**.

Here's a breakdown:
1. **Limited action**: when you believe something is impossible or highly improbable you are less likely to take action on it.
2. **Limited beliefs**: holding onto limiting beliefs can prevent you from seeing opportunities or solutions that are right in front of you.
3. **Self-fulfilling prophecy**: constantly thinking about negative things can sabotage your efforts, leading to negative outcomes.
4. **Energy and motivation**: having a child's mind and thinking about everything as an opportunity to learn and grow can significantly change the way you approach things.
5. **Attraction and repulsion**: your thoughts can attract or repel opportunities and people. For example, if you have a mindset of abundance, you might attract opportunities and people that align with that mindset. Conversely, a scarcity mindset might repel those same opportunities.


## Conclusion

I read this book on a friend's recommendation, and it reminded me of [Napoleon Hill's Golden Rules: The Lost Writings](https://www.amazon.com/NAPOLEON-HILLS-GOLDEN-RULES-Napoleon/dp/0470411562) book.
I liked how the author takes the reader through different perceptions like success, health, or relationships to prove his point that everything starts in our minds.

It's a short book and feels more like an introduction to the **_"power of thought."_**
If you're looking for concrete advice on applying the power of thought in your life, this is not a very rich source.
However, it's a good read.
