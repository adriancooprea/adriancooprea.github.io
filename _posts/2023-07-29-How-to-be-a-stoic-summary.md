## What's this book about?

**"How To Be a Stoic"** is not just a theoretical exploration of ancient philosophy but a practical guide that applies the principles of stoicism to the challenges of modern life.
It gives readers actionable advice on managing their emotions, dealing with adversity, and living more fulfilling lives.

The book reinterprets stoicism, a philosophy often misunderstood as advocating for emotionless living, to promote a balanced and thoughtful response to life's ups and downs instead.
It offers a roadmap for individuals seeking **tranquility**, **effectiveness**, and **mindfulness** in their everyday lives.

## Actionable ideas

#### 1. Reframe your impressions to improve your mood

Acknowledge that most things you feel are `impressions` or `interpretations` of certain situations. When you feel anxious, angry, or envious, try thinking about what makes you feel that way. Try different perspectives:
- (`Anxious`) What if she meant to help me by giving me that negative feedback?
- (`Angry`) What if he didn't realize it bothered me?
- (`Envious`) What about the things that I've already achieved?

You can change your perception and improve your mood by reframing your initial opinion to a healthier one. Most things are not what they seem. They're just opinions.

#### 2. Focus on what you can control to improve your effectiveness

According to the Stoics, few things are in our control.
These include our `thoughts`, `desires`, `behaviors`, and `reactions` (*although this is partially true if we consider the findings in the Psychology field regarding biases and other behavioral influences*). Embracing [The Dichotomy Of Control]({% post_url 2023-07-29-The-Dichotomy-of-Control %}) helps us focus our energy and attention on what we can control and accept what we can't control.
- **Don't focus** on whether you're winning the competition. **Focus** instead on giving your best.
- **Don't focus** on what other people think of you. **Focus** on being a virtuous person.
- **Don't focus** on the misfortune that got you down. **Focus** on your opportunities, abilities, and resources to improve your situation.

We can't control the outcome, but we can control our actions and reactions.

#### 3. Practice *premeditatio malorum* to improve your resilience

This is a type of `negative visualization` through **meditation**.
By thinking about possible negative situations before they potentially happen, you can improve your reactions and cope with real events if they occur.
**Setting the right expectations** (*or rather lowering them*) and preparing for all scenarios, not only the positive ones, can help you deal with adversity and avoid disappointment.

- You planned a city break with your partner.
  - What if it rains?
  - What if you get sick?
  - What if you lose your luggage?
- You're about to give a presentation.
  - What if you forget your lines?
  - What if you get nervous?
  - What if you get interrupted?

One could argue that thinking about all negative scenarios can be counterproductive and lead to anxiety and procrastination.
What's the point in doing something if you're going to fail anyway?

However, stoicism is not about advocating pessimism but realism. It encourages preparedness for the worst while hoping for the best.

#### 4. Develop a life plan to improve your life satisfaction

**Who are you? What do you want out of life? What is the most important thing to you? What do you want to be remembered for? What are your goals?**
Many people don't answer these questions because they fear finding out they're lying to themselves.
It's challenging to have a blunt conversation with yourself and assert how you spend your time versus what you truly desire.

Stoics argue that knowing what you want in life and fulfilling your goals will raise your life satisfaction and make a living feel meaningful.
You need to live in **accordance** with who you are. You need to be **disciplined** and say no to everything that's not aligned with who you want to be (*instant gratification, external validation*)

- (`Life purpose`) Imagine you're at your funeral. What would you want people to say about it? Your wife? Your daughter? Your friends? Your co-workers? (source 7 Habits of Highly Effective People)
- (`Role models`) Who would you choose if you were to pick five mentors to develop yourself?
- (`Values`) If you'd plan the perfect week, what would it look like?

#### 5. Reflect on your day to improve your self-awareness

One of the best practices for self-improvement advocated not only by the stoics is `reflection`.
Whether done via **journaling**, **meditation**, or simply **contemplating**, it's a high-value activity with several health benefits.
The purpose of this exercise is to highlight blind spots in your thinking and behavior, make sure you're not deviating from your mission and goals, and help you understand what you're going through.

You can start small by asking three simple questions at the end of the day:
- What did I do wrong today?
- What did I do well today?
- How can I be better tomorrow?

## Key takeaways

#### 1. Stoicism is misunderstood

Stoicism is often **misunderstood** and associated with the image of a stone, a cold and emotionless state that's the same in all situations and circumstances.
It is believed that you should suppress your emotions, avoid social engagement because of your inability to control what others would do, and accept whatever comes to you with a smile on your face.

It's easy to judge what you don't understand or don't want to understand. Stoicism, however, is something very different:
- it teaches you to **acknowledge** your emotions and their cause.
- it helps you **focus** on the things you can change or influence and not waste your energy on those you can't.
- it gives you a set of tools and practices, so you can find **meaning** in your life and achieve **tranquility**.
- it guides you in the realm of **spiritual** exercises (*reflection, negative visualization, journaling*).
- it introduces you to the idea of **serving** others to build a better world.

#### 2. We constantly break our integrity when we don't know who we are

**Opportunity**, **FOMO(Fear of Missing Out)**, **Result-Driven Society**, and **Instant Gratification** are just a few things that characterize society nowadays.
Practicing patience, excellence, ethics, and philosophy is boring.
We often find ourselves drawn to stories of quick wealth, like someone getting rich overnight from a dubious cryptocurrency investment, or narratives of ruthless ambition where someone climbs the corporate ladder without regard for others.
We are interested in high-reward, fast, effortless achievements.

When you are unsure of your identity, purpose, and desires, `insecurities` can dominate.
You act based on `fear`, not `confidence`. Every moment of your life is a constant struggle:
- I said I wouldn't buy expensive apparel, but I feel insecure going out dressed ordinary.
- I said I wouldn't drink anymore, but they would exclude me from the group if I didn't.
- I said I wouldn't gossip anymore, but it would be awkward if I told them I didn't like that.

Promises to yourself are just as important as promises to others.
When you don't keep them, you break integrity, which adds up.
Although you may justify your actions with various excuses, your subconscious knows your true character.
That's why you feel ashamed or guilty of what you did on the second day.

Unless you define who you are and start keeping promises to yourself, you'll constantly feel a sensation that something needs to be fixed.
You can hide it away by experiencing different pleasures, but eventually, it catches up.

#### 3. Virtue can be cultivated

What should you do when you realize your current lifestyle is unsustainable? How can you learn to live more virtuously?
Can you learn to live virtuously?

Some of us are luckier than others and have a more virtuous genetic legacy.
Some of us have better role models that teach us the art of self-reflection early in childhood.
Regardless of our current situation, as adults, we can continue improving our virtuousness by relying on `explicit philosophical reflection` or observing and imitating specific `role models`.

The concept of having role models is a very powerful habit.
That's why stoic writings go hand-in-hand with their preachers.
For example:
- When you go through a difficult situation, you first ask, *"What would Epictetus think of this?"*.
- Then you think how would he answer: *"Men are disturbed not by things, but by the view which they take of them."*
- Then you apply corresponding practices: go away and meditate.

This is the power of role models.
You get to talk to them whenever you're facing a difficult situation.
And by imitating them, you change your behavior, perspective, and, ultimately, yourself.

**Your actions determine who you are**.

#### 4. Stoicism is indifferent to religion beliefs

The stoic philosophy holds **virtue** as the highest good.
It is based on knowledge and emphasizes the idea of ["logos,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos#:~:text=The%20Stoics%20also%20referred%20to,a%20logos%20or%20spiritual%20principle.) which can be identified with **God**, **Nature**, or the laws of the **Universe**.
From the stoic perspective, it doesn't matter if you believe that your misfortune was a punishment from God, an effect on something you did in the past (*Karma*), or simply a random chance.
What matters is to accept reality, maintain a state of **tranquility** and peace regardless of external circumstances, and focus on **virtue** and **reasoning**.

*The universal principles upon which stoicism is based - wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance - are common to most religions.*

#### 5. To live authentically, you need to accept the impermanence of things.

Stoicism puts a great deal on understanding and embracing `death`.
This idea serves as two compasses in the life of the practitioner:
- no illusion about immortality and no fear about this unavoidable fact that will happen.
- live the present moment, accept whatever comes to you, and prepare yourself to end life in tranquility.

The idea of impermanence also applies to other things, such as your **loved ones**, **health**, or **wealth**.
People lose interest in the things they already have and show gratitude less often.
Practicing negative visualization and accepting things as impermanent opens new ways of living and enjoying life.
- When you think this might be your last day on earth or that a friend could die tomorrow, would you still act the way you do?
- How would a father fructify his time with his daughter knowing she might be gone in a fraction of a second?
- How would a couple respond to a fight if they knew they could lose each other the next day?
- Would you still smoke if you knew you would get lung cancer in a year if you didn't stop?

These perspectives of the world, this simple idea of finite, make you more empathetic, more present, and more grateful for the time you have.
Instead of passing through life carelessly and pitifully, you can start living and ensuring you've done everything right when death gets you.

**There's nothing to be afraid of when you give it all.**

## Conclusion

I stumbled upon this book by chance when browsing Amazon's recommendations for Ryan Holiday's books.
It serves as an introductory guide to the philosophy of stoicism, and the author has done an excellent job of explaining it through practical examples.
If you are already acquainted with the fundamental principles of stoicism, the four virtues, and the disciplines, this book may not provide any new insights.
However, if you are just starting on your stoic journey, this book is an excellent place to begin.
