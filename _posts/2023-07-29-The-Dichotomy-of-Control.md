The Stoic Dichotomy of Control is a fundamental concept in Stoic philosophy that categorizes things into two distinct groups:
things we can control and things we cannot control.
Things we can control are largely our own behaviors, thoughts, and reactions, such as our judgments, desires, aversions, and actions. On the other hand, things we cannot control include external events, circumstances, and the actions of others.

The Stoics argue that understanding and accepting this dichotomy leads to a more peaceful and virtuous life.
They advise focusing our energy and attention on the things we can control and accepting or being indifferent to the things we cannot control.
This principle is often used as a guide to navigate life's challenges and cultivate resilience, tranquility, and wisdom.
