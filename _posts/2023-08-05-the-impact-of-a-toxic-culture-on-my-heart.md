> What's your heart rate telling you about your workplace culture?

I've been using the **Apple Watch** for the past five years.
I've been wearing it **non-stop** for the last two years - during sleep, sport, and desk hours - all the time.
That's a lot of data available to improve your life, test out things, and adapt accordingly.

A few weeks back, I received a notification from the **Health** app telling me that my average resting **heart rate** had decreased in the last **21 weeks**.
That looked strange initially.
I started to think about what had changed in my life in the previous couple of months.
There were no significant changes in my routine, diet, or training.
I exercise 4-5 times a week, I eat healthy, I don't smoke, I avoid alcohol as much as possible, and I try to sleep before 23:30.
However, there was one thing that changed: at the end of last year, I `quit` my previous job.

It was a toxic workplace with lots of **gossip**, **politics**, and **games of power**.
I knew it. But I kept playing the game, thinking everybody was doing it one way or another, so why complain?
It was the kind of company in which you felt like you were on a treadmill: one week was happy, positive, or decent, and the next one, you felt miserable.
I can't even remember how many times I said I wanted to leave. But eventually, after five years and eight months, it got me.
I had had enough. So I left.

The graph shows that my average resting heart rate decreased starting in January.
I knew about the negative mental effects of toxic cultures(*[this](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/19/12318) is a great study on that*), but I didn't think about how these effects(*anxiety, depression, anger*) could affect my physical health.
Since joining [APM Terminals](https://www.apmterminals.com/), I feel more relaxed, enjoy starting a workday, and sleep much better (*according to my [sleep tracking app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/autosleep-track-sleep-on-watch/id1164801111)*).
I didn't change anything else in my routine, but the difference is significant.

So, how is your body feeling after a work week at your current workplace? Do you monitor it? What does it tell?
