I was reading **[Do Hard Things](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Things-Resilience-Surprising-Toughness/dp/006309861X)** by **[Steve Magness](https://www.stevemagness.com/about/)**(*I fully recommend this book*) when I came across an interesting idea on **helplessness**.
As the story goes, some experiments on classical conditioning, which used dogs and mice, proved that when subjects repeatedly learn they have **no control** over negative situations, they **stop trying** to escape them.
They become lethargic, accepting the status quo.
They switch to survival mode.

This example is rough and refers to physically induced pain.
The best examples that sustain and prove this idea are the war prisoners who went through long periods of torture or the victims of the German concentration camps.
Although these two examples are probably some of the darkest in history(*check [Man's Search for Meaning](https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl-ebook/dp/B009U9S6FI) by Viktor Frankl or the story of [James Stockdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stockdale)*), helplessness can be cultivated in all circumstances.
Some examples are:
- The abusive husband that repeats to his wife she will not survive without him.
- The abusive parent that repeats to his child that he is not enough.
- The bureaucratic system that makes you go through a slow and useless process every time.
- The friends that tell you starting a business or living a dream will not work out because it is highly improbable.

### Learned Helplessness In The Workplace
##### Salary Negotiations
When I started thinking about the organizational workplace and how it applies to it, I realized how my ex-boss used the same tactic to control me and other employees.
Whenever I asked for a raise I thought I deserved, he would do certain things to dismiss my request:
- He would often point out that others are doing more for less.
- He would often argue that my current rate is in accordance with the market.
- He would often say he knows about other workplaces where people work longer for the same rate.
- He would often talk about how AI would take over, and we would lose our jobs.

It was not about my performance being under expectations or needing to deliver more value.
It was just that ***"This is normal, and I have to accept it, and I better appreciate it because I might lose it."***
I took everything he said for granted, as it was pure truth, even though he never came up with tangible proof for his statements.

##### General Changes and Improvements
Similarly, when discussing improvements or changes, he would usually agree with proposals but never act on them.
It became a pattern. It was common knowledge that nothing ever changes in the company.
I had no control over our work environment and I accepted it.
I stopped trying to change it, eventually.
It was a state of learned helplessness.

##### The Solution
It was a bad work environment, but due to the induced **lack of control and fear** that I would not find anything better, I stayed.
Not only that, but it felt like I'd **lose** something if I left and tried something different.
I got lucky and got my head out of the sand.
It felt scary to leave, and the uncertainty of the future was overwhelming.
But once I did it, I realized how much I was missing out on.
I realized how much I was capable of.

### Final Thoughts
Fortunately, there is a way out of every situation.
People can **re-learn** they have control and can be trained out of helplessness.
Even as a prisoner, when you don't have control over your life or death, you still have control over your dignity and attitude toward your circumstances.
You can choose how you respond(*check [The Dichotomy Of Control]({% post_url 2023-07-29-The-Dichotomy-of-Control %})*).

Getting your head out of the sand is hard, primarily when you're used to the status quo.
But you can do it.
