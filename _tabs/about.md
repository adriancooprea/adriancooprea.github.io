Hello there, and **welcome** to my notes site!
My name is **Adrian**, I'm a **software engineer**, and I write about various things.

### Who am I? (bragging included)

#### Intro

- **⏰ Experience**: over seven years in the field
- **🎩 Hats**: developer, technical lead, engineering manager
- **🧠 Areas of expertise**: developing, testing, architecting, hiring, coaching, and team performance
- **🏆 Biggest achievement**: successfully built and launched a product ([SkyRoster](https://www.skyroster.com/))

My career goal is to work with people and help them achieve their true potential.
I took a detour in my professional journey and returned to improving my technical area 
to better prepare for what's next(`#todo` check Why I went from Engineering Manager to Software Engineer).

> Currently, I'm working for [APM Terminals](https://www.apmterminals.com/) as a Senior Software Engineer ([let's connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-oprea/))

#### Spare time
During my free time, I enjoy spending quality moments with my family, consisting of my wife and daughter.
I find pleasure in reading, writing, and contemplating.
To stay physically fit, I hit the gym four days a week and engage in kickboxing twice a week(`#todo` more about My Fitness Routine).

### What are my notes about?

I'm a big fan of concepts such as [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/), 
[Personal Knowledge Management Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management), 
[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), 
and [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). 
I like to write what I think and connect the dots. 
I believe productivity is often confused with quantity instead of quality, and that's where these methods shine.

In my note-taking approach, I use two types of notes: 
**`material notes`** (similar to the notion of [Literature Notes from the Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/concepts-sohnke-ahrens-explained/#literature-notes-a-subcategory-of-permanent-notes)) 
that reflect my understanding of a given source like a podcast, course, youtube video, article, or book, 
and **`general notes`** which reflect my intuition, knowledge, experience.

This website doesn't target a specific area of interest, such as software development, 
but instead focuses on all areas of life as a whole. 
I write about **software engineering, productivity, philosophy, lifestyle, or life in general** 
whenever I come across something interesting, insightful, or need to reference it later.

I'm sharing these notes with you in the hope that you'll find them useful.
